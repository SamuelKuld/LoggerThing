# LoggerThing
Just a logger that I am adding to occasionally to get opinions of my code.

I am mostly working on this as leisure, but also in testing of different code attitudes and disciplines. I am trying to decide what the best form of practice is.

I understand a lot of it is based on preference and what the workplace calls for. As of now I am not working in any professional capacity, but it bothers me how little I really know about what I *should* be writing. I think what would help me most is working collaboratively on something with someone, but fun thing is that there really isn't anyone I know who does code. At least, someone in person. So I am kinda limited to.. asking for online help such as this. Anyway. I'll go over some of the flaws I noticed, that I can't tell if I can or can't go without.

A big thing I have been having issues with is levels of abstraction. For about a month now, I've maximized as much abstraction as I can. To the extent where my code read like English. But I was told that was a bad practice. So what.. What should the goal here be? Is this good code? What would make it better?
